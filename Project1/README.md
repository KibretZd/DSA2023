# Project 1 - Student Information Management using Arrays
## Instruction

* This project is a group assignment of maximum 5 students per each group.
* Code sharing across groups is ***`strictly forbidden`***
* Add appropriate comments on your code
* Each group member must participate equally on the project
* There will be presentation and there will be question and answering individually.
* You have to submit on time.
* **Deadline** for project submission will untill **January 14, 2024 @3:00PM**.

Note: Make sure you are using proper code indentation.

## About the project
This student management system has the following functionanlities:
1. Registers a new student to the student list
2. Removes a student from the list using the ID of a student
3. Updates a student by ID number of a student
4. search a student/s by:
    * Searches a particular student by using ID number of a student
    * Search and prints all students by first name of the student
    * Search and prints all students by last name of the student
    * Search and prints all students by department

5. Sort students in ascending order using:
    - By student names
    - ID number
    - Department
6. Prints all students
7. Print the all the **female** students and number of female student
8. Print the all the **male** students and number of female student
9. Prints total Number of student already added to the list

Some the functionalities such as mentioned above have not been implemented. Your task is to write the code for them.

## About your task in this project
In this project I have already implemented most of the tasks for you. 
To start working on the project:
1. download this project on your local machine and make sure that you have downloaded all the files in ***Project1*** directory.

2. Open ***`testStudent.cpp`*** file using your prefered IDE (Integrated Development Environment) usually ***code block***.
3. After you open the file, compile and run ***`testStudent.cpp`*** file from your IDE
5. Once you run the program you can perform most of the functionalities such as:
    - add a student
    - remove a student
    - update a student record
    - sort by name
    - print all students
    - print onle female students
    - ... others which are implemented.

Next open **`studentlist.h`** file using the IDE and write your code as instructed.
You are expected to write code for unimplemented functions from **```studentlist.h```** file.
Some of the function that are not implemented from the file **```studentlist.h```** are as follows:
1. **`searchByLastName(string lastName)`**
```
    void StudentList::searchByLastName(string lastName)const
    {
        // Write your code 
    }
```

2. **`searchByDepartment(string department)`**
```
    void StudentList::searchByDepartment(string department)const{
        // Write your code 
    }
```
3. **`void StudentList::maleStudents() const`**
```
    void StudentList::maleStudents() const
    {
        // Write your code 
        
    }
```
4. **`sortByDepartment()`**
```void StudentList::sortByDepartment()
    {
        // write your code 
    }
```
5. **`sortByAge()`**
```
    void StudentList::sortByAge()
    {
        // Write your code 
    }
```

6. **`sortByIdNumber()`**
```
    void StudentList::sortByIdNumber()
    {

        // Write your code 
    }
```

## Finaly
After implementing those function, save your file and run your program to test if they are working as intended or not.
Remember always you have to run the ***`testStudent.cpp`*** file.
